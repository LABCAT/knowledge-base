# Migrating Files

## Special Copy

Copy a file from your local machine to a server directory:

```scp ~/Documents/file.txt user@ip.add.re.ss:/var/www/file.txt```

Copy a file from a server to your local machine:

```scp user@ip.add.re.ss:/var/www/file.txt ~/Documents/files.txt```

## RYSNC

If you want to copy entire directories, then it is better to use rysnc as if there is an error during the process you donâ€™t need to restart from the beginning like you do with scp.

Copy a folder (and all files and folders it contains) from a server to your local machine:

```rsync -chavzP --stats user@ip.add.re.ss:/path/to/copy /path/to/local/storage```

Copy a folder (and all files and folders it contains) from your local machine to a server:

```rsync -chavzP --stats /path/to/local/storage user@ip.add.re.ss:/path/to/copy```
